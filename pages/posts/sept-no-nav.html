    <h1>September 2022</h1>

    <h3>Akshita</h3>
    <p>
      This month went by really quickly but here are some things I would like to highlight:
      <ul>
        <li>New ITP landing page for prospective students!! This is the main project I have been working on and will be working on during the entire residency. The project has been a WIP for the last one year and we are taking it forward to roll out in Spring 2022!! This could have not been possible without the incredible Siteseers team and I am so grateful for Elias and Yonatan to join the team and help things move forward. 
        </li>
        <li>
          I have also been helping out with the Design Lab workshops and recently hosted the one on Figma. Eden and Michael have been a great support with the whole process. New hires for Design Lan are here too, really excited to have them on board. 
        </li>
        <li>
          In collaboration with Design Lab and with immense help and support from Eden, Vesper and Emma, I am organizing the Inktober Challenge 2022 at ITP. It will be a 2 weeks mini-challenge similar to 100 days format wherein everyone has to create an art piece everyday using ink and in the end we’ll display all the work in a gallery format in the Media Commons. The art pieces can take any form and the ink can be applied using any medium - want to make a flip book? Or use a plotter to create a piece? The list is endless. Look out for the email soon. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Sam is building a corset and I am helping her in whatever little ways I can! Garment construction is a tedious process and has been an integral part of my journey as an undergrad. Although I have made different types of garments in the past, this would be my first contribution to a corset. 
        </li>
        <li>Ami and I recently went to a workshop on Kalamkari by artist Nikita Shah. It was a truly incredible experience and I learned so much about this great art form from India. We are in the process of organising a session for the ITP/IMA Community soon with Nikita. Really excited for this! </li>
        <img>
        <img>
        <li>For my personal exploration and building up on my thesis where I used traditional textile with technology, I plan to do Kalamkari painting using conductive paint to create an installation of sound and light. Hopefully. It is still an idea and a wip but hopefully I can do justice to the art form and tell a story. </li>
        <li>Also tried Mike’s Hot Honey Iced Latte at Blank Street! Has a spicy aftertaste in the throat. Sam and Alan recommend the hot latte version with Almond Milk!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Phil</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>I started learning some audio reactive touch designer
        </li>
        <li>Noah and I deigned, built, and tested the volumetric camera rig that lives in room 223
        </li>
        <li>
        Sam and I started the design process for our custom keyboard, pics and progress coming soon
        </li>
        <li>
          After Alan led a cyanotype workshop at the Fall Residence Retreat, Sam and I have digitized them in order to start creating an ML model with the images.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’m also currently working on a custom dashboard insert for a 1976 Toyota Celica GT. It’s a custom designed part which was then 3D printed. Right now I’m in the paint/sand cycle so I can achieve a perfect surface finish on the part.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Eden</h3>
    <p>
      Processes and projects that are emerging:
      <ul>
        <li>Alternative processes for photography, particularly methods that abstract images, particularly figures, in unexpected and even grotesque ways
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Considering new materials to create prints ie., What would it look like to print photographs on fabric and create a quilt? Why am I interested in this process? What photographs would I use as source material?   
          </li>
          <li>Hunches: relationship to femininity and domestic labor, relationship to the body and how we care for it, quilts as (family) heirlooms, fractured/discarded swatches that are put back together again to create a beautiful object, something once deemed useless is repurposed and made whole
          </li>
          <li>I am investigating this process as a second thesis! That I do alongside my thesis group in a more private way this time around.
          </li>
          <img>
        </ul>
        <li>Onboarded Design Lab Staff! Really excited to be working with Akshita, Michael, and the student DL mentors, Ruhsona, Vesper, Bei, Suraj, and Lifei!
        </li>
        <li>Planning courses for outside of the ITP community. Two teaching roles will be kicking off next week and the following!
        </li>
        <li><i>Her Body and Other Parties</i> by Carmen Maria Machado. Highly recommend this book for a spooky and engaging read! It’s an incredible collection of short stories.
        </li>
        <li>I’m working with an artist named Billie Allen to plan a solo show of his works. Learn more about ways to support him <a href="http://linkt.ee/freebillieallen">here</a>.
        </li>
      </ul> 
    </p>

    <h3>Dave</h3>
    <p>
      I’m excited to be working with MK and Vesper on Live Code Club! A club centered around Live Coding, performance, and critique. We want to make a safe space to fail in! We want to learn and explore together. No coding or musical experience required. Join our discord here: https://discord.gg/P23QEgPE
      <ul>
        <li>Enjoying ICM and PCOMP help sessions.
        </li>
        <li>Working on games, music & teaching Front End Web.
        </li>
        <li>Researching ways to reuse old, broken, forgotten, unwanted devices.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Sam</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>I’ve been starting to build lots of things! My overall theme for making stuff are “things that I would like to have in my house”, starting with turning my thesis into a dining table.
          <img>
          I have a couple of things in the pipeline:
          <img>
        </li>
        <li>I’m making an e-ink clock for my bedroom that will display the time and when the next train comes! So far I’ve realized that MTA uses a funky format for their real time data and it is hard to make that request from an arduino, so I’m doing the backend with python which I have working and setting up a server that sends only the relevant trains to the microcontroller.
          </li>
          <li>I’m also building a corset! Akshita and Daniel Ryan have been super helpful in getting this project started! Eden also helped me print out the pattern on the vinyl printer.
          </li> 
          <li>Phil and I are building a custom keyboard case together. Earlier this week we started modeling the PCB that we have and are creating the 3D model that will be printed.
          </li>
          <li>I also have been doing a bunch of research on tarot to inspire a new speculative ritual involving reframed tarot cards (since the Rider-Waite deck is somewhat problematic and rooted in Christian and medieval history). I’m using Stable Diffusion to create new cards, and I’ve developed the “Lucifer” card as my start. Here are some of the images I’ve created so far:

  <h3>Daniel Ryan</h3>
    <p>I can’t believe it’s only been a month so far. It has gone by so fast!  I’ve been teaching an intro to wearables class in IMA that has been an amazing learning opportunity; 7 weeks is a very short amount of time.  I’m very excited to see what the students create!  I’ve also been working on a continuation of my thesis. In collaboration with Stefanie Koseff, IDM second year, we’ll be showing our tactile graphics of textile based items at the Intrepid in late October.  
    </p>
    <p>I am so excited to explore both  non-visual interpretation and wearables further this year.

    <p>It’s been a strange start to the month. Every time the cold rolls around, I’m like: it was hot, now it’s cold, and I can’t seem to stop repeating the obvious. In this obvious hot and cold, I am: 
      <ul>
      <li>
        Writing a series on semiotics of the abortion rights movement for PRINT Magazine. My next piece is focused on religious imagery in the seventies and the Moral Majority so I’m deep in the archives.
      </li>
      <li>
        Making virtual nightmare mobiles in C4D, inspired by Alexander Calder’s mobiles and Takeshi Murata’s hyperrealistic compositions, along with bedtime fables. A grownup twist on sleep mobiles? 
      </li>
    </ul>
    There’s a book on my desk called Death By Landscape. It’s so good. So are all of Elvia Wilk’s pieces if you’re interested in narrative, dystopia/utopia, the natural world, and lyric essays. Keep an eye out for the Adjacent zine on nature + humanity + technology this winter.

    <p>So. <i>deep breath*</i></p>

    <p>An analog audio signal is just a current generated by a power source whose voltage follows the shape of the original sound wave, meaning it goes up and down really quickly over time just like the sound wave. If you amplify that signal by some 200x, it becomes strong enough to power a laser diode. Since the voltage is going up and down with the sound wave, the resulting brightness of that laser beam will have the audio information “encoded” in it. If you shine that laser beam at a solar panel and then connect the output of that solar panel to a speaker, you’ll hear the original sound. You can then transmit sound like a radio wave through a laser beam across hundreds of feet! The audio quality is pretty awful but it’s very fun to do.</p>

    <p>I learned about all that over the summer and found the concept very interesting, and I’m using it as the foundation for a musical “zoetrope”-style instrument. You cut a sound wave out of a strip of opaque plastic and then form that plastic into a ring and place a laser diode in the center. If you shine the laser through a lens that turns the dot into a line, and then shine that through the plastic, the amount of the laser light blocked by the plastic depends on the height (amplitude) of the sound wave at that point. In other words, if you spin the wave around the laser really fast, the amount of laser light passing through will resemble the sound wave right? So if you place a solar panel hooked up to a speaker on the other end, you should hear the sound of the wave printed on the plastic! You can loop through VERY short audio samples like this, the duration depends on the circumference of your plastic ring and how much information you can fit onto it. For reference, the plastic ring I’ve got on my prototype at the moment is roughly 70cm long, and I’m expecting to get maybe half a second of looping audio out of it, optimistically.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I’m really excited about eventually having maybe a half-functional prototype that sounds not awful! Hoping to put together some documentation to show everyone how it works as well, as I realize it must sound really confusing on paper. Please pull me aside and ask me about it if you’re curious!</p>

    <p>Aside from that, I’m working with Akshita, Elias and a few others on developing what will become the new ITP website. I pulled an almost-all-nighter working on that and am still recovering from it 2 days later. </p>

  <h3>Tora</h3>

      <p>Here we are, a group of 16</br>
      Resident reader, what’s it going to be?
      </p>

      <p>There is excitement, but also some pain</br>
      Will my residency be what I aim?
      </p>

      <p>
        Reading, making, finding, fun</br>
        Everyone coming together as one
      </p>

      <p> 
      As a group we have each other</br>
      What would we do without one another?
      </p>

      <p>
      I’m grateful to be here, it’s a marvelous thing</br>
      Excited for what this one year will bring
      </p>

      <p>
      An opportunity given to try something new</br>
      Who will I be when all this is through?
      </p>

      <p>
      Day after day, slowly finding the answer</br>
      Exploring the new, that’s what we came here to do
      </p>


  <h3>Tinrey</h3>

      <p>I recently finished playing a game Called 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. I bought this game a year ago but never opened it until now. This game is really groundbreaking and inspirational, in my opinion, in terms of its complicated way of storytelling in gameplay. The game has 13 main characters, and the player has to explore the same story  from 13 different perspectives in order to see the whole image of this mysterious Sci-fi world and find out the truth. I spent in total almost 50 hours to finish the game because each character’s perspective is intertwined with the others, and I just couldn’t stop until I finished the whole story. Most importantly, the art and visuals of this game is SPECTACULAR!</p>

      <p>Things I am working on now: 
        <ul>
          <li>An art project related to motion capture, face tracking, photogrammetry and animation.</li>
          <li>Brainstorming the ideas and development about a first-person / VR game which tells the story of my dad. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Things I am interested in now: 
        <ul>
          <li>How to become  a VR VTuber. </li>
          <li>Live performing in VR through motion capture.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>When you mix Potassium Ferricyanide and Ferric Ammonium Citrate, coat it on an absorbent material, and expose it to the sun, you get an alternative photographic print developed in 1842 by Sir John Herschel called the Cyanotype.</p> 

      <p>The beautiful thing about this process is that it is extremely forgiving, easy to set up, and you can make a photographic print of anything. For our experiment, we used watercolor paper and found materials, including flowers, dirt, orange peels, sticks, and pieces of paper. Working quickly, we made our collages, covered them with a sheet of glass to prevent the wind from blowing anything away, and let the sun do the rest. </p>


      <p>Process Image:</p>

      <i>First exposure of 20 mins wasn’t long enough, leaving the prints too dull.</i>

      <img>

      <i>Our second exposure of 40 mins was perfect. </i>

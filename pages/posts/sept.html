      <h3>Akshita Bawa</h3>
      <p>
        This month went by really quickly but here are some things I would like to highlight:
        <ul>
          <li>New ITP landing page for prospective students!! This is the main project I have been working on and will be working on during the entire residency. The project has been a WIP for the last one year and we are taking it forward to roll out in Spring 2022!! This could have not been possible without the incredible Siteseers team and I am so grateful for Elias and Yonatan to join the team and help things move forward. 
          </li>
          <li>
            I have also been helping out with the Design Lab workshops and recently hosted the one on Figma. Eden and Michael have been a great support with the whole process. New hires for Design Lan are here too, really excited to have them on board. 
          </li>
          <li>
            In collaboration with Design Lab and with immense help and support from Eden, Vesper and Emma, I am organizing the Inktober Challenge 2022 at ITP. It will be a 2 weeks mini-challenge similar to 100 days format wherein everyone has to create an art piece everyday using ink and in the end we’ll display all the work in a gallery format in the Media Commons. The art pieces can take any form and the ink can be applied using any medium - want to make a flip book? Or use a plotter to create a piece? The list is endless. Look out for the email soon. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Sam is building a corset and I am helping her in whatever little ways I can! Garment construction is a tedious process and has been an integral part of my journey as an undergrad. Although I have made different types of garments in the past, this would be my first contribution to a corset. 
          </li>
          <li>Ami and I recently went to a workshop on Kalamkari by artist Nikita Shah. It was a truly incredible experience and I learned so much about this great art form from India. We are in the process of organising a session for the ITP/IMA Community soon with Nikita. Really excited for this! </li>
          <img>
          <img>
          <li>For my personal exploration and building up on my thesis where I used traditional textile with technology, I plan to do Kalamkari painting using conductive paint to create an installation of sound and light. Hopefully. It is still an idea and a wip but hopefully I can do justice to the art form and tell a story. </li>
          <li>Also tried Mike’s Hot Honey Iced Latte at Blank Street! Has a spicy aftertaste in the throat. Sam and Alan recommend the hot latte version with Almond Milk!</li>

      <h3>Phil</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I started learning some audio reactive touch designer
            </li>
            <li>Noah and I deigned, built, and tested the volumetric camera rig that lives in room 223
            </li>
            <li>
            Sam and I started the design process for our custom keyboard, pics and progress coming soon
            </li>
            <li>
              After Alan led a cyanotype workshop at the Fall Residence Retreat, Sam and I have digitized them in order to start creating an ML model with the images.
            </li>
            <li>
              I’m also currently working on a custom dashboard insert for a 1976 Toyota Celica GT. It’s a custom designed part which was then 3D printed. Right now I’m in the paint/sand cycle so I can achieve a perfect surface finish on the part.
            </li>

        <h3>Eden</h3>
        <p>
          Processes and projects that are emerging:
          <ul>
            <li>Alternative processes for photography, particularly methods that abstract images, particularly figures, in unexpected and even grotesque ways
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Considering new materials to create prints ie., What would it look like to print photographs on fabric and create a quilt? Why am I interested in this process? What photographs would I use as source material?   
              </li>
              <li>Hunches: relationship to femininity and domestic labor, relationship to the body and how we care for it, quilts as (family) heirlooms, fractured/discarded swatches that are put back together again to create a beautiful object, something once deemed useless is repurposed and made whole
              </li>
              <li>I am investigating this process as a second thesis! That I do alongside my thesis group in a more private way this time around.
              </li>
              <img>
            </ul>
            <li>Onboarded Design Lab Staff! Really excited to be working with Akshita, Michael, and the student DL mentors, Ruhsona, Vesper, Bei, Suraj, and Lifei!
            </li>
            <li>Planning courses for outside of the ITP community. Two teaching roles will be kicking off next week and the following!
            </li>
            <li><i>Her Body and Other Parties</i> by Carmen Maria Machado. Highly recommend this book for a spooky and engaging read! It’s an incredible collection of short stories.
            </li>
            <li>I’m working with an artist named Billie Allen to plan a solo show of his works. Learn more about ways to support him <a href="http://linkt.ee/freebillieallen">here</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>

          I’m excited to be working with MK and Vesper on Live Code Club! A club centered around Live Coding, performance, and critique. We want to make a safe space to fail in! We want to learn and explore together. No coding or musical experience required. Join our discord here: https://discord.gg/P23QEgPE
          <ul>
            <li>Enjoying ICM and PCOMP help sessions.
            </li>
            <li>Working on games, music & teaching Front End Web.
            </li>

        <h3>Sam</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I’ve been starting to build lots of things! My overall theme for making stuff are “things that I would like to have in my house”, starting with turning my thesis into a dining table.
              <img>
              I have a couple of things in the pipeline:
              <img>
            </li>
            <li>I’m making an e-ink clock for my bedroom that will display the time and when the next train comes! So far I’ve realized that MTA uses a funky format for their real time data and it is hard to make that request from an arduino, so I’m doing the backend with python which I have working and setting up a server that sends only the relevant trains to the microcontroller.
              </li>
              <li>I’m also building a corset! Akshita and Daniel Ryan have been super helpful in getting this project started! Eden also helped me print out the pattern on the vinyl printer.
              </li> 
              <li>Phil and I are building a custom keyboard case together. Earlier this week we started modeling the PCB that we have and are creating the 3D model that will be printed.
              </li>
              <li>I also have been doing a bunch of research on tarot to inspire a new speculative ritual involving reframed tarot cards (since the Rider-Waite deck is somewhat problematic and rooted in Christian and medieval history). I’m using Stable Diffusion to create new cards, and I’ve developed the “Lucifer” card as my start. Here are some of the images I’ve created so far:
                <img>
                <img>
                <img>
              </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

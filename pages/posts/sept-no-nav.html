    <h1>September 2022</h1>
    <h3>Akshita Bawa</h3>
    <p>
      This month went by really quickly but here are some things I would like to highlight:
      <ul>
        <li>New ITP landing page for prospective students!! This is the main project I have been working on and will be working on during the entire residency. The project has been a WIP for the last one year and we are taking it forward to roll out in Spring 2022!! This could have not been possible without the incredible Siteseers team and I am so grateful for Elias and Yonatan to join the team and help things move forward. 
        </li>

          I have also been helping out with the Design Lab workshops and recently hosted the one on Figma. Eden and Michael have been a great support with the whole process. New hires for Design Lan are here too, really excited to have them on board. 
        </li>

          In collaboration with Design Lab and with immense help and support from Eden, Vesper and Emma, I am organizing the Inktober Challenge 2022 at ITP. It will be a 2 weeks mini-challenge similar to 100 days format wherein everyone has to create an art piece everyday using ink and in the end we’ll display all the work in a gallery format in the Media Commons. The art pieces can take any form and the ink can be applied using any medium - want to make a flip book? Or use a plotter to create a piece? The list is endless. Look out for the email soon. 
        </li>

          Sam is building a corset and I am helping her in whatever little ways I can! Garment construction is a tedious process and has been an integral part of my journey as an undergrad. Although I have made different types of garments in the past, this would be my first contribution to a corset. 
        </li>
        <li>Ami and I recently went to a workshop on Kalamkari by artist Nikita Shah. It was a truly incredible experience and I learned so much about this great art form from India. We are in the process of organising a session for the ITP/IMA Community soon with Nikita. Really excited for this! </li>

        <li>For my personal exploration and building up on my thesis where I used traditional textile with technology, I plan to do Kalamkari painting using conductive paint to create an installation of sound and light. Hopefully. It is still an idea and a wip but hopefully I can do justice to the art form and tell a story. </li>
        <li>Also tried Mike’s Hot Honey Iced Latte at Blank Street! Has a spicy aftertaste in the throat. Sam and Alan recommend the hot latte version with Almond Milk!</li>
